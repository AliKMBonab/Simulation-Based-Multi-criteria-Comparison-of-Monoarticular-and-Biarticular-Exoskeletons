01. metabolic energy and actuators energy has been normalized to the gait cycle duration of the subject gait cycle. It means that the J/s or W is outcome of energy calculations.
02. explain hierarchical structure of data and how we are treating it.
03. add the muscles power and its method
04. explain that the hip torque and the knee speed are in two different reference frames
05. explain the inertia of the leg about hip joint and where it is coming from
06. explain the weight distribution
07. modified augmentation factor
08. root mean square error in each phases
09. inertial compensation is necessary with controller or design
10. mass of segments needs to be changed

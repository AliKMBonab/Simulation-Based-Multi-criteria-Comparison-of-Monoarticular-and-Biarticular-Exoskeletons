	abstract = {Abstract Compared to most quadrupedal mammals, humans are energetically inefficient when running at high speeds. This fact can be taken to mean that human bipedalism evolved for reasons other than to reduce relative energy cost during locomotion. Recalculation of the energy expended during human walking at normal speeds shows that (1) human bipedalism is at least as efficient as typical mammalian quadrupedalism and (2) human gait is much more efficient than bipedal or quadrupedal locomotion in the chimpanzee. We conclude that bipedalism bestowed an energetic advantage on the Miocene hominoid ancestors of the Hominidae.},

	abstract = {Tools have been used for millions of years to augment the capabilities of the human body, allowing us to accomplish tasks that would otherwise be difficult or impossible. Powered exoskeletons and other assistive devices are sophisticated modern tools that have restored bipedal locomotion in individuals with paraplegia and have endowed unimpaired individuals with superhuman strength. Despite these successes, designing assistive devices that reduce energy consumption during running remains a substantial challenge, in part because these devices disrupt the dynamics of a complex, finely tuned biological system. Furthermore, designers have hitherto relied primarily on experiments, which cannot report muscle-level energy consumption and are fraught with practical challenges. In this study, we use OpenSim to generate muscle-driven simulations of 10 human subjects running at 2 and 5 m/s. We then add ideal, massless assistive devices to our simulations and examine the predicted changes in muscle recruitment patterns and metabolic power consumption. Our simulations suggest that an assistive device should not necessarily apply the net joint moment generated by muscles during unassisted running, and an assistive device can reduce the activity of muscles that do not cross the assisted joint. Our results corroborate and suggest biomechanical explanations for similar effects observed by experimentalists, and can be used to form hypotheses for future experimental studies. The models, simulations, and software used in this study are freely available at simtk.org and can provide insight into assistive device design that complements experimental approaches.},

	abstract = {The energetic cost of running is relatively high in man. In spite of this, humans are adept endurance runners, capable of running down, for example, zebra and kangaroo. Distance running is made possible for man in part by an exceptional ability to dissipate exercise heat loads. Most mammals lose heat by panting, which is coupled to breathing and locomotor cycles during running. This interdependence may limit the effectiveness of panting as a means of heat dissipation. Because sweating is not dependent on respiration, it may be more compatible with running as a thermoregulatory mechanism. Furthermore, man's lack of body hair improves thermal conductance while running, as it facilitates convection at the skin surface. While horses, for example, have been shown to possess energetically optimal speeds in each gait, the energetic cost for a man to run a given distance does not change with speed. It is hypothesized that this is because bipedality allows breathing frequency to vary relative to stride frequency. Man's constant cost of transport may enable human hunters to pursue the prey animal at speeds that force it to run inefficiently, thereby expediting its eventual fatigue. Given what is known of heat dissipation in Old World Anthropoidea, the bipedality of early hominids, and human exercise physiology, one factor important in the origin of the Hominidae may have been the occupation of a new niche as a diurnal endurance predator.},

	abstract = {The present study examined whether resistance and stretching training programmes altered the viscoelastic properties of human tendon structures in vivo. Eight subjects completed 8 weeks (4 days per week) of resistance training which consisted of unilateral plantar flexion at 70 \% of one repetition maximum with 10 repetitions per set (5 sets per day). They performed resistance training (RT) on one side and resistance training and static stretching training (RST; 10 min per day, 7 days per week) on the other side. Before and after training, the elongation of the tendon structures in the medial gastrocnemius muscle was directly measured using ultrasonography, while the subjects performed ramp isometric plantar flexion up to the voluntary maximum, followed by a ramp relaxation. The relationship between estimated muscle force (Fm) and tendon elongation (L) was fitted to a linear regression, the slope of which was defined as stiffness. The hysteresis was calculated as the ratio of the area within the Fm-L loop to the area beneath the load portion of the curve. The stiffness increased significantly by 18.8 ± 10.4 \% for RT and 15.3 ± 9.3 \% for RST. There was no significant difference in the relative increase of stiffness between RT and RST. The hysteresis, on the other hand, decreased 17 ± 20 \% for RST, but was unchanged for RT. These results suggested that the resistance training increased the stiffness of tendon structures as well as muscle strength and size, and the stretching training affected the viscosity of tendon structures but not the elasticity.},,

	abstract = "Muscles generate force to resist gravitational and inertial forces and/or to undertake work, e.g. on the centre of mass. A trade-off in muscle architecture exists in muscles that do both; the fibres should be as short as possible to minimise activation cost but long enough to maintain an appropriate shortening velocity. Energetic cost is also influenced by tendon compliance which modulates the timecourse of muscle mechanical work. Here we use a Hill-type muscle model of the human medial gastrocnemius to determine the muscle fascicle length and Achilles tendon compliance that maximise efficiency during the stance phase of walking (1.2m/s) and running (3.2 and 3.9m/s). A broad range of muscle fascicle lengths (ranging from 45 to 70mm) and tendon stiffness values (150–500N/mm) can achieve close to optimal efficiency at each speed of locomotion; however, efficient walking requires shorter muscle fascicles and a more compliant tendon than running. The values that maximise efficiency are within the range measured in normal populations. A non-linear toe-region region of the tendon force–length properties may further influence the optimal values, requiring a stiffer tendon with slightly longer muscle fascicles; however, it does not alter the main results. We conclude that muscle fibre length and tendon compliance combinations may be tuned to maximise efficiency under a given gait condition. Efficiency is maximised when the required volume of muscle is minimised, which may also help reduce limb inertia and basal metabolic costs."

Methods  This article summarizes our current understanding of the construct of individual QOL as it pertains to persons with intellectual disabilities (ID). The article's three major sections discuss what we know, what we are beginning to understand, and what we still do not know about the QOL construct. Results  We currently know the importance of the QOL construct as a service delivery principle, along with its current use and multidimensional nature. We are beginning to understand the importance of methodological pluralism in the assessment of QOL, the multiple uses of quality indicators, the predictors of assessed QOL, the effects of different data collection strategies, and the etic (universal) and emic (culture-bound) properties of the construct. We have yet to understand fully the use of QOL-related outcomes in programme change, how to best evaluate the outcomes of QOL-related services, and how to use the concept of QOL to impact public and disability reform. Conclusion  The article concludes with a brief discussion of future challenges related to demonstrating the concept's social validity and positive impact on the lives of persons with ID.},,

	abstract="Most of the available data on the aging of muscle function are cross-sectional in type. Static and dynamic muscle strength seem well preserved to about 45 years of age, but performance deteriorates by about 5{\%} per decade thereafter. There is a parallel loss of lean tissue. Because muscle biopsy specimens are not always representative of an entire muscle, it is unclear whether there is a general hypotrophy or atrophy of the muscle fibres or a selective hypoplasia and degeneration of type II fibres associated with a loss of terminal sprouting. Other influences may include a deterioration of end-plate structures with impaired excitation-contraction coupling and impaired fibre recruitment. Both contraction time and half-relaxation time are prolonged with aging, and there is a decrease of maximal contraction velocity, more marked in the legs than in the arms. On the other hand, endurance at a fixed fraction of maximal force is increased. Potential factors leading to the enhanced endurance include a poorer maximal effort and an increased proportion of type I fibres; however, there is little evidence that muscle capillarity is altered. The loss of function is generally less in the arms than in the legs, but it remains unclear whether this is an inherent biological difference, or merely a reflection of differential changes in activity patterns between the upper and the lower limbs. The male/female strength ratio does not seem to change with age, but substantial slowing or reversal of the aging process is possible through appropriate activity programmes. The preservation of muscle function has important implications for the quality of life in the frail elderly, counteracting dyspnoea, stabilising joints and extending the period of independent living by up to 20 years.",

Abilities to develop joint torques rapidly may be critical to such responses. We undertook this study to quantify age effects among healthy adults in abilities to develop ankle joint torques rapidly.Methods. Ankle dorsiflexion (DF) and plantarflexion (PF) torque development during rapid isometric and during isokinetic (30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 deg/sec) exertions was assessed in 24 healthy young (mean age 23 years) and 24 healthy old adults (mean age 72 years). The effects of age, gender, and torque direction on the times needed to reach given torque magnitudes, maximum rates of isometric torque development (MRTD), and maximum isokinetic torques were examined.Results. The old adults required substantially more time to reach given torque magnitudes than the young adults. For example, the young and old females needed approximately 236 and 337 msec to develop 15 Nm of DF torque, of which 141 and 164 msec were reaction times. Isometric MRTD were 25 to 36\\% lower in the old than in the young adults. The age declines in isometric torque development time were associated with losses in maximum isometric strength. Maximum isokinetic torques developed by the old were 20 to 40\\% lower than those of young adults. The percent losses in isokinetic torques with age were independent of joint angular velocity for PF, but increased with velocity for DF.Conclusions. We found substantial age declines in abilities of healthy old adults to rapidly develop ankle joint torques. The capacities of even healthy old adults to recover balance or to carry out other time-critical actions that require moderate-to-substantial strengths may be considerably degraded by these declines.}",

Men were found to be stronger than women at all ages. In both sexes, the average values for maximum voluntary strength of the dorsiflexors and plantarflexors began to decline in the 6th decade. Although the absolute loss of strength was greater for the plantarflexor muscles, the relative losses were similar in the two muscle groups. During maximum voluntary effort, stimulation of motor nerves produced no additional torque in the majority of elderly men and women, indicating that these subjects remained able to utilize their descending motor pathways for optimal muscle activation. Comparisons of muscle compound action potentials, twitch torques, and muscle cross-sectional areas suggested that a decrease in excitable muscle mass was entirely responsible for the lower strength of the elderly. An additional effect of aging was the gradual prolongation of twitch contraction and half-relaxation times throughout the adult life-span. }

Ten younger women [31.9 (SD 6.1) years] and ten older women [71.1 (SD 6.6) years] were tested using a KIN-COM 500H dynamometer. The PE was tested by stretching the muscles from relaxed plantarflexion to the maximal dorsiflexion (DF) angle at 5{\textdegree}{\textperiodcentered}s−1 without raw electromyogram (EMG) activity exceeding 0.05 mV. The maximal CIT was tested from the maximal DF angle 60{\textdegree} into plantarflexion at four randomly ordered velocities of 30, 60, 120, and 180{\textdegree}{\textperiodcentered}s−1. Separate analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests showed that the standardized ({\%} body mass) concentric peak and mean torques were lower for the older women for all isokinetic velocities (p < 0.001). The ``angular delay'' from the onset of concentric activation to peak torque was smaller for the older women at 120 and 180{\textdegree}{\textperiodcentered}s−1 (p < 0.05). Age showed negative relationships (Pearson r) with all standardized peak torques (p ⩽ 0.001) and mean torques (p < 0.001), and the ``angular delay'' at 120 and 180{\textdegree}{\textperiodcentered}s−1 (p ⩽ 0.05). Independent t-tests showed that the maximal DF angle and the change in the PE angle from an initial angle (defined at 10{\%} of the maximal passive torque) to the maximal DF angle were less for the older women (p < 0.05). Age was negatively related to the maximal DF angle and the change in the PE angle (p < 0.01). The results suggest an age-related decrease in calf muscle CIT, muscle length and PE. The smaller ``angular delay'' for the older women at 120 and 180{\textdegree}{\textperiodcentered}s−1 indicates that CIT testing at rapid velocities can be used to examine age-related changes in calf muscle contractile properties in relation to rapid velocities of movement.",

	abstract = "The biomechanical patterns that characterize the gait of persons who have sustained a stroke are reviewed. Reduced walking speed and longer stance phases, greater on the unaffected side, are reported. Variations in joint excursions include several deviations at initial contact and reduced excursions during swing. Electromyographic patterns have provided a classification method. Joint moment reports were variable, but included high hip flexor moments in late stance, positively related to speed. The muscle groups of the unaffected side performed about 60% of the work of walking across speeds. Commonly occurring gait deviations resulting from particular impairments or adaptations to impairments are identified."

After consideration of the effects (of the disturbed motor control resulting from stroke) on the gait movements and the expected rate of recovery of walking capacity, different methods of assessment are considered. Emphasis is placed on selecting the appropriate measurement tool according to the individual’s level of function. Also, the need to measure walking performance under different environmental constraints and the importance of instrument responsiveness to change over the range of walking disabilities are discussed. Task-related training with the opportunity for large amounts of practice is recommended to improve walking performance after stroke."

However, it is unknown whether gait variability could be used as a marker of impaired walking performance post-stroke. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether gait variability measures could be used as walking performance measures post-stroke. Hemiparetic variability was compared to healthy gait variability and associated to clinical assessments that evaluate impaired performance post-stroke. Spatiotemporal characteristics were collected from 94 persons with post-stroke hemiparesis and 22 similarly aged healthy persons as they walked over an instrumented mat. Gait variability was calculated as the standard deviation in step lengths, stride widths, pre-swing, swing and stride times. Hemiparetic performance was evaluated using lower-extremity Fugl-Meyer grading, dynamic gait index scale (available in population sub-sets) and an asymmetry index. Results revealed that variability increased in step length, swing, pre-swing and stride times (p<.001) during hemiparetic walking as compared to healthy gait. Paretic leg swing time variability was increased compared to the non-paretic during hemiparetic walking (p<.001). Between-leg differences in variability for other spatiotemporal characteristics were revealed in participants with the most impaired performance. Further, increased step variability and reduced width variability related to poor performance outcomes (severe hemiparesis, asymmetrical gait and poor balance). Patterns of gait variability were evident within sub-groups of the hemiparetic population. Results of this study suggest that between-leg differences in swing and pre-swing time variability, increased step length and stride time variability and decreased width variability are quantifiable markers of impaired walking performance poststroke."

Multiple linear regression analysis was used to select the combination of paretic limb impairments (frontal and sagittal plane hip strength, sagittal plane knee and ankle strength, and multi-joint knee/hip torque coupling) which best estimate gait speed and compensatory pelvic obliquity velocities at toeoff. Compensatory behaviors were defined as deviations from control subjects’ values. The gait speed model (n=18; p=0.003) revealed that greater hip abduction strength and multi-joint coupling of sagittal plane knee and frontal plane hip torques were associated with decreased velocity; however, gait speed was positively associated with paretic hip extension strength. Multi-joint coupling was the most influential predictor of gait speed. The second model (n=15; p<0.001) revealed that multi-joint coupling was associated with increased compensatory pelvic movement at toeoff; while hip extension and flexion and knee flexion strength were associated with reduced frontal plane pelvic compensations. In this case, hip extension strength had the greatest influence on pelvic behavior. The analyses revealed that different yet overlapping sets of single joint strength and multi-joint coupling measures were associated with gait speed and compensatory pelvic behavior during walking post-stroke. These findings provide insight regarding the potential impact of targeted rehabilitation paradigms on improving speed and compensatory kinematics following stroke."

	abstract={The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of load carriage on transit time during simulated escape route evacuation. Subjects (8 males, 5 females) completed two maximal field hikes in random order on two successive days (16 kg [35 lb] line gear pack trial and no pack trial). Subjects carried a fire shelter and a Pulaski (the most commonly used fireline construction tool in the United States, consisting of a hoe/ax combination with an 80 cm handle) during each trial. Trials were completed on a dirt trail 660.5 m in length with a vertical rise of 137 m (average grade = 20.75\%). Expired air samples were analysed continuously during each trial (Cosmed K4 or Aerosport VO2000). Blood samples were collected before and 2 min after exercise for lactate analysis. Transit time was significantly faster during the No pack trial, representing a 21.5 and 26.3\% faster transit time for males and females, respectively. For the males, mean VO2 was higher during the No pack trial. The difference in blood lactate (peak\&\#8211;rest) was significantly higher during the Pack trial for the male subjects. High correlations between peak VO2 (L min\&\#8211;1) and transit rates were noted (r = 0.82 for the Pack trial and 0.87 for the No pack trial), indicating the contribution of aerobic fitness to transit time. These data suggest that escape routes should include a physical strain index related to load carriage, distance and slope and that line gear weight standards should be further evaluated.},

	abstract = "{This study reviews historical and biomedical aspects of soldier load carriage. Before the 18th century, foot soldiers seldom carried more than 15 kg while on the march, but loads have progressively risen since then. This load increase is presumably due to the weight of weapons and equipment that incorporate new technologies to increase protection, firepower, communications, and mobility. Research shows that locating the load center of mass as close as possible to the body center of mass results in the lowest energy cost and tends to keep the body in an upright position similar to unloaded walking. Loads carried on other parts of the body result in higher energy expenditures: each kilogram added to the foot increases energy expenditure 7\\% to 10\\%; each kilogram added to the thigh increases energy expenditure 4\\%. Hip belts on rucksacks should be used whenever possible as they reduce pressure on the shoulders and increase comfort. Low or mid-back load placement might be preferable on uneven terrain but high load placement may be best for even terrain. In some tactical situations, combat load carts can be used, and these can considerably reduce energy expenditure and improve performance. Physical training that includes aerobic exercise, resistance training targeted at specific muscle groups, and regular road marching can considerably improve road marching speed and efficiency. The energy cost of walking with backpack loads increases progressively with increases in weight carried, body mass, walking speed, or grade; type of terrain also influences energy cost. Predictive equations have been developed, but these may not be accurate for prolonged load carriage. Common injuries associated with prolonged load carriage include foot blisters, stress fractures, back strains, metatarsalgia, rucksack palsy, and knee pain. Load carriage can be facilitated by lightening loads, improving load distribution, optimizing load-carriage equipment, and taking preventive action to reduce the incidence of injury.}",

	abstract = {Abstract Background The etiology of work-related back disorders is often population specific. The objective of this study was to identify and establish the association of occupational risk factors with the prevalence of low back (LB) problems in a semi-automated South African Steel industry. Methods The design entailed an analytical cross-sectional epidemiological study among a group of 366 steel plant workers. Outcome of LB problems was defined using a guided questionnaire and a functional rating index. Exposure to occupational risk factors was determined using self-reported questionnaires. Results Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated significant adjusted odds ratios (OR) for twisting and bending (OR 2.81; CI 1.02–7.73); bulky manual handling (5.58; 1.16–26.71); load carriage (7.20; 1.60–32.37); prolonged sitting (2.33; 1.01–5.37); kneeling and squatting (4.62; 1.28–16.60); and working on slippery and uneven surfaces (3.63; 1.20–10.90). Conclusions This study supports the current view of a multifactorial etiology in idiopathic LB problems, and emphasizes the importance of multiple intervention strategies in industrial settings. Am.

They are designed in different architectures to assist their users’ movements. The research literature has been more prolific on lower-limb devices: a main reason is that they address a basic but fundamental motion task, walking. Leg exoskeletons are simpler to design, compared to upper-limb counterparts, but still have particular cognitive and physical requirements from the emerging human–robot interaction systems. In the state of the art, different control strategies and approaches can be easily found: it is still a challenge to develop an assistive strategy which makes the exoskeleton supply efficient and natural assistance. So, this paper aims to provide a systematic overview of the assistive strategies utilized by active locomotion–augmentation orthoses and exoskeletons. Based on the literature collected from Web of Science and Scopus, we have studied the main robotic devices with a focus on the way they are controlled to deliver assistance; the relevant validations are as well investigated, in particular experimentations with human in the loop. Finally current trends and major challenges in the development of an assistive strategy are concluded and discussed."

	abstract = {Background Even though walking can be sustained for great distances, considerable energy is required for plantarflexion around the instant of opposite leg heel contact. Different groups attempted to reduce metabolic cost with exoskeletons but none could achieve a reduction beyond the level of walking without exoskeleton, possibly because there is no consensus on the optimal actuation timing. The main research question of our study was whether it is possible to obtain a higher reduction in metabolic cost by tuning the actuation timing.   Methodology/Principal Findings We measured metabolic cost by means of respiratory gas analysis. Test subjects walked with a simple pneumatic exoskeleton that assists plantarflexion with different actuation timings. We found that the exoskeleton can reduce metabolic cost by 0.18±0.06 W kg−1 or 6±2% (standard error of the mean) (p = 0.019) below the cost of walking without exoskeleton if actuation starts just before opposite leg heel contact.   Conclusions/Significance The optimum timing that we found concurs with the prediction from a mathematical model of walking. While the present exoskeleton was not ambulant, measurements of joint kinetics reveal that the required power could be recycled from knee extension deceleration work that occurs naturally during walking. This demonstrates that it is theoretically possible to build future ambulant exoskeletons that reduce metabolic cost, without power supply restrictions.},

	abstract = {Passive assistance devices such as canes and braces are often used by people after stroke, but mobility remains limited for some patients. Awad et al. studied the effects of active assistance (delivery of supportive force) during walking in nine patients in the chronic phase of stroke recovery. A soft robotic exosuit worn on the partially paralyzed lower limb reduced interlimb propulsion asymmetry, increased ankle dorsiflexion, and reduced the energy required to walk when powered on during treadmill and overground walking tests. The exosuit could be adjusted to deliver supportive force during the early or late phase of the gait cycle depending on the patient{\textquoteright}s needs. Although long-term therapeutic studies are necessary, the immediate improvement in walking performance observed using the powered exosuit makes this a promising approach for neurorehabilitation.Stroke-induced hemiparetic gait is characteristically slow and metabolically expensive. Passive assistive devices such as ankle-foot orthoses are often prescribed to increase function and independence after stroke; however, walking remains highly impaired despite{\textemdash}and perhaps because of{\textemdash}their use. We sought to determine whether a soft wearable robot (exosuit) designed to supplement the paretic limb{\textquoteright}s residual ability to generate both forward propulsion and ground clearance could facilitate more normal walking after stroke. Exosuits transmit mechanical power generated by actuators to a wearer through the interaction of garment-like, functional textile anchors and cable-based transmissions. We evaluated the immediate effects of an exosuit actively assisting the paretic limb of individuals in the chronic phase of stroke recovery during treadmill and overground walking. Using controlled, treadmill-based biomechanical investigation, we demonstrate that exosuits can function in synchrony with a wearer{\textquoteright}s paretic limb to facilitate an immediate 5.33 {\textpm} 0.91{\textdegree} increase in the paretic ankle{\textquoteright}s swing phase dorsiflexion and 11 {\textpm} 3\% increase in the paretic limb{\textquoteright}s generation of forward propulsion (P \&lt; 0.05). These improvements in paretic limb function contributed to a 20 {\textpm} 4\% reduction in forward propulsion interlimb asymmetry and a 10 {\textpm} 3\% reduction in the energy cost of walking, which is equivalent to a 32 {\textpm} 9\% reduction in the metabolic burden associated with poststroke walking. Relatively low assistance (~12\% of biological torques) delivered with a lightweight and nonrestrictive exosuit was sufficient to facilitate more normal walking in ambulatory individuals after stroke. Future work will focus on understanding how exosuit-induced improvements in walking performance may be leveraged to improve mobility after stroke.},

	journal={Medicine \& Science in Sports \& Exercise},
	year={2007},
	volume={39},
	number={3},
    abstract={ABSTRACT Purpose:  The metabolic cost of walking increases when mass is added to the legs, but the effects of load magnitude and location on the energetics and biomechanics of walking are unclear. We hypothesized that with leg loading 1) net metabolic rate would be related to the moment of inertia of the leg (Ileg), 2) kinematics would be conserved, except for heavy foot loads, and 3) swing-phase sagittal-plane net muscle moments and swing-phase leg-muscle electromyography (EMG) would increase. Methods:  Five adult males walked on a force-measuring treadmill at 1.25 m{\textperiodcentered}s-1 with no load and with loads of 2 and 4 kg per foot and shank, 4 and 8 kg per thigh, and 4, 8, and 16 kg on the waist. We recorded metabolic rate and sagittal-plane kinematics and net muscle moments about the hip, knee, and ankle during the single-stance and swing phases, and EMG of key leg muscles. Results:  Net metabolic rate during walking increased with load mass and more distal location and was correlated with Ileg (r2 = 0.43). Thigh loading was relatively inexpensive, helping to explain why the metabolic rate during walking is not strongly affected by body mass distribution. Kinematics, single-stance and swing-phase muscle moments, and EMG were similar while walking with no load or with waist, thigh, or shank loads. The increase in net metabolic rate with foot loading was associated with greater EMG of muscles that initiate leg swing and greater swing-phase muscle moments. Conclusions:  Distal leg loads increase the metabolic rate required for swinging the leg. The increase in metabolic rate with more proximal loads may be attributable to a combination of supporting (via hip abduction muscles) and propagating the swing leg.},

	abstract = {The intrinsic muscular properties of biological muscles are the main source of stabilization during locomotion, and superior biological performance is obtained with low energy costs. Man-made actuators struggle to reach the same energy efficiency seen in biological muscles. Here, we compare muscle properties within a one-dimensional and a two-segmented hopping leg. Different force–length–velocity relations (constant, linear, and Hill) were adopted for these two proposed models, and the stable maximum hopping heights from both cases were used to estimate the cost of hopping. We then performed a fine-grained analysis during landing and takeoff of the best performing cases, and concluded that the force–velocity Hill-type model is, at maximum hopping height, the most efficient for both linear and segmented models. While hopping at the same height the force–velocity Hill-type relation outperformed the linear relation as well. Finally, knee angles between 60° and 90° presented a lower energy expenditure than other morphologies for both Hill-type and constant relations during maximum hopping height. This work compares different muscular properties in terms of energy efficiency within different geometries, and these results can be applied to decrease energy costs of current actuators and robots during locomotion.}

Its great versatility and flexibility has led to many attempts at building walking machines with similar capabilities. The control of walking is an active research area both in neurobiology and robotics, with a large and growing body of work. This paper gives an overview of the current knowledge on the control of legged locomotion in animals and machines and attempts to give walking control researchers from biology and robotics an overview of the current knowledge in both fields. We try to summarize the knowledge on the neurobiological basis of walking control in animals, emphasizing common principles seen in different species. In a section on walking robots, we review common approaches to walking controller design with a slight emphasis on biped walking control. We show where parallels between robotic and neurobiological walking controllers exist and how robotics and biology may benefit from each other. Finally, we discuss where research in the two fields diverges and suggest ways to bridge these gaps.}

As a consequence, translations of the body centre of gravity or translations of a distal segment relative to the trunk are the result of transformations of rotations in joints into the desired translations. This leads to a number of constraints associated with these transformations which depend on the mechanically formulated task demands. Experimental kinematic and kinetic data on jumping and cycling show that the temporally ordered sequence in timing of leg muscle activation patterns as well as co-activation of mono-articular hip and knee extensor muscles and their bi-articular antagonists are in concert with these constraints. Bi-articular muscles transport the mechanical output of mono-articular muscles to joints where it can effectively contribute to the desired aim of the movement. The universal nature of the constraints is illustrated and some possible consequences for the control of movement are discussed."

In particular, a net power transfer was shown from hip to knee joint during jumping and sprinting. Seven elite athletes performed explosive one legged jump and sprint push-offs. Kinematics, ground reaction forces and electromyography (EMG) of leg muscles were recorded. The mechanical output of six individual muscle groups was estimated by using Hill-based muscle models. The EMG and kinematics served as input to these models. For jumping as well as for sprinting, the model estimated similar results for the relative work contribution done about a joint due to transfer of power by the biarticular muscles. Rectus femoris showed a power transfer from hip to knee joint, while in contrast hamstrings showed a power transfer from knee to hip joint. Regardless of these opposite directions of power transfer, a net transfer occurred from the hip to the knee joint. The relative work contribution of hamstrings done in hip extension was 7% in jumping and 11% in sprinting. For rectus femoris, the relative work contribution done in knee extension was 21% in jumping and 31% in sprinting. Power transferring actions by gastrocnemius from knee to ankle contributed 25% in jumping and 28% in sprinting to the work done in plantar flexion. These results support the hypothesis that the action of biarticular muscles contributes to a net transfer of power from proximal to distal joints during explosive leg extensions. This action of the biarticular muscles causes an efficient conversion of body segment rotations into the desired translation of the body centre of gravity."

In humans, biarticular elements have been identified as one of the reasons for the energy economy of locomotion. This document gives an extensive literature overview concerning the function of biarticular muscles in human beings. The exact role of these muscles in the efficiency of human locomotion is reduced to three elementary functions: energy transfer towards distal joints, efficient control of output force direction and double joint actuation. This information is used to give an insight in the application of biarticular elements in bio-inspired robotics, i.e. bipedal robots, exoskeletons, robotic manipulators and prostheses. Additionally, an attempt is made to find an answer on the question whether the biarticular property leads to a unique contribution to energy efficiency of locomotion, unachievable by mono-articular alternatives. This knowledge is then further utilised to indicate how biarticular actuation of exoskeletons can contribute to an increased performance in reducing user effort.}

	abstract = { While simple models can be helpful in identifying basic features of muscle function, more complex models are needed to discern the functional roles of specific muscles in movement. In this paper, two very different models of walking, one simple and one complex, are used to study how muscle forces, gravitational forces and centrifugal forces (i.e. forces arising from motion of the joints) combine to produce the pattern of force exerted on the ground. Both the simple model and the complex one predict that muscles contribute significantly to the ground force pattern generated in walking; indeed, both models show that muscle action is responsible for the appearance of the two peaks in the vertical force. The simple model, an inverted double pendulum, suggests further that the first and second peaks are due to net extensor muscle moments exerted about the knee and ankle, respectively. Analyses based on a much more complex, muscle–actuated simulation of walking are in general agreement with these results; however, the more detailed model also reveals that both the hip extensor and hip abductor muscles contribute significantly to vertical motion of the centre of mass, and therefore to the appearance of the first peak in the vertical ground force, in early single–leg stance. This discrepancy in the model predictions is most probably explained by the difference in model complexity. First, movements of the upper body in the sagittal plane are not represented properly in the double–pendulum model, which may explain the anomalous result obtained for the contribution of a hip–extensor torque to the vertical ground force. Second, the double–pendulum model incorporates only three of the six major elements of walking, whereas the complex model is fully 3D and incorporates all six gait determinants. In particular, pelvic list occurs primarily in the frontal plane, so there is the potential for this mechanism to contribute significantly to the vertical ground force, especially during early single–leg stance when the hip abductors are activated with considerable force. }

	abstract={A three-dimensional, neuromusculoskeletal model of the body was combined with dynamic optimization theory to simulate normal walking on level ground. The body was modeled as a 23 degree-of-freedom mechanical linkage, actuated by 54 muscles. The dynamic optimization problem was to calculate the muscle excitation histories, muscle forces, and limb motions subject to minimum metabolic energy expenditure per unit distance traveled. Muscle metabolic energy was calculated by summing five terms: the basal or resting heat, activation heat, maintenance heat, shortening heat, and the mechanical work done by all the muscles in the model. The gait cycle was assumed to be symmetric; that is, the muscle excitations for the right and left legs and the initial and terminal states in the model were assumed to be equal. Importantly, a tracking problem was not solved. Rather, only a set of terminal constraints was placed on the states of the model to enforce repeatability of the gait cycle. Quantitative comparisons of the model predictions with patterns of body-segmental displacements, ground-reaction forces, and muscle activations obtained from experiment show that the simulation reproduces the salient features of normal gait. The simulation results suggest that minimum metabolic energy per unit distance traveled is a valid measure of walking performance.},

For instance, the line of action of the mono-articular vastus medialis passes anterior to the flexion/extension axis of the knee joint, and therefore the muscle is classified as a knee extensor. Similarly, the bi-articular gastrocnemius is classified as a knee flexor and ankle plantar flexor. As such, the gastrocnemius is considered to be an antagonist of the vasti at the knee joint.",

	abstract = "The main result of this study is that biarticular leg muscles contribute significantly to the work done at joints, due to transfer of power during explosive leg extensions. In particular, a net power transfer was shown from hip to knee joint during jumping and sprinting. Seven elite athletes performed explosive one legged jump and sprint push-offs. Kinematics, ground reaction forces and electromyography (EMG) of leg muscles were recorded. The mechanical output of six individual muscle groups was estimated by using Hill-based muscle models. The EMG and kinematics served as input to these models. For jumping as well as for sprinting, the model estimated similar results for the relative work contribution done about a joint due to transfer of power by the biarticular muscles. Rectus femoris showed a power transfer from hip to knee joint, while in contrast hamstrings showed a power transfer from knee to hip joint. Regardless of these opposite directions of power transfer, a net transfer occurred from the hip to the knee joint. The relative work contribution of hamstrings done in hip extension was 7% in jumping and 11% in sprinting. For rectus femoris, the relative work contribution done in knee extension was 21% in jumping and 31% in sprinting. Power transferring actions by gastrocnemius from knee to ankle contributed 25% in jumping and 28% in sprinting to the work done in plantar flexion. These results support the hypothesis that the action of biarticular muscles contributes to a net transfer of power from proximal to distal joints during explosive leg extensions. This action of the biarticular muscles causes an efficient conversion of body segment rotations into the desired translation of the body centre of gravity."

	abstract = "The amount of mechanical energy transferred by two-joint muscles between leg joints during squat vertical jumps, during landings after jumping down from a height of 0.5 m, and during jogging were evaluated experimentally. The experiments were conducted on five healthy subjects (body height, 1.68–1.86 m; and mass, 64–82 kg). The coordinates of the markers on the body and the ground reactions were recorded by optical methods and a force platform, respectively. By solving the inverse problem of dynamics for the two-dimensional, four-link model of a leg with eight muscles, the power developed by the joint (net muscular) moments and the power developed by each muscle were determined. The energy transferred by two-joint muscles from and to each joint was determined as a result of the time integration of the difference between the power developed at the joint by the joint moment, and the total power of the muscles serving a given joint. It was shown that during a squat vertical jump and in the push-off phase during running, the two-joint muscles (rectus femoris and gastrocnemius) transfer mechanical energy from the proximal joints of the leg to the distal ones. At landing and in the shock-absorbing phase during running, the two-joint muscles transfer energy from the distal to proximal joints. The maximum amount of energy transferred from the proximal joints to distal ones was equal to 178.6 ± 45.7 J (97.1 ± 27.2% of the work done by the joint moment at the hip joint) at the squat vertical jump. The maximum amount of energy transferred from the distal to proximal joints was equal to 18.6 ± 4.2 J (38.5 ± 36.4% of work done by the joint moment at the ankle joint) at landing. The conclusion was made that the one-joint muscles of the proximal links compensate for the deficiency in work production of the distal one-joint muscles by the distribution of mechanical energy between joints through the two-joint muscles. During the push-off phase, the muscles of the proximal links help to extend the distal joints by transferring to them a part of the generated mechanical energy. During the shock-absorbing phase, the muscles of the proximal links help the distal muscles to dissipate the mechanical energy of the body."

	abstract = "The mechanical energy expenditures (MEEs) of two human lower extremity models with different sources of mechanical energy—(1) muscles and (2) joint moments—were compared theoretically. Sources of mechanical energy producing movement of Model 1 were eight muscles, three of which were two-joint muscles. Sources of mechanical energy producing movement of Model 2 were net moments at its joints. These sources of mechanical energy were substituted by 11 one-joint muscles, with the assumption that antagonistic muscles did not produce force. Because of this assumption, summed MEE of all joint moments and all one-joint muscles of Model 2 were the same. It was shown that during the same movement the model with two-joint muscles could spend less mechanical energy than the model without two-joint muscles. This economy of mechanical energy realized by two-joint muscles was possible if (i) signs of the muscle powers which were produced by the two-joint muscle at both joints were opposite, (ii) moments produced by that muscle at each of the two joints had the same direction as the net joint moments at these joints, and (iii) muscles crossing these two joints from the opposite side did not produce force. Realization of these three conditions during human locomotion was checked experimentally. Electrical activity of eight lower extremity muscles of ten subjects was measured during treadmill walking and running. Based on this information, the periods where the muscles produce force were estimated. Moments and their power at joints of the lower extremity of two subjects performing walking and running were calculated using kinematics and ground reaction force measurements, and an inverse dynamics approach. It was shown that MEE of models with different sources of mechanical energy appeared to be different during certain periods of the swing phase. However, the magnitude of this difference was probably relatively small."

The assumptions made concerning the transfer of energy between different parts of the body are part of the problem. This investigation assesses the role of transfer in energy saving and specifically, the possibility of two-joint muscles reducing the mechanical energy cost of a movement compared to a system having one-joint muscles only. An algorithm was developed which recruited one-joint or both one- and two-joint muscles to supply the net joint moments. The work performed under these two conditions was the compared. It was found that activation of both one- and two-joint musculature reduced the mechanical work cost during walking by between 7 and 29% over that required by single-joint musculature alone. This investigation supports suggestions in the literature that one of the functions of two-joint musculature is to reduce the mechanical energy cost and probably the metabolic cost of movement."

	abstract="The stiffness that is measured at the hand of a multijoint arm emerges from the combined effects of the elastic properties of the muscles and joints, the geometry of the linkages and muscle attachments, and the neural control circuits that act on the arm. The effective stiffness of a nonlinear linkage such as a two-joint arm depends on the force acting on the system as well as the intrinsic stiffness of the actuators. This paper presents an analysis of the factors that affect limb stiffness, including the effects of external forces. Three potential strategies for controlling the stability of the limb are proposed and demonstrated by computer simulations. The predictions from the simulations are then compared experimentally with measured stiffness values for human subjects working against an external force. These experiments were directed toward understanding what strategies are used by the CNS to control limb stiffness and stability. The experimental evidence showed that human subjects must increase the stiffness at the joints in order to maintain limb stability in the presence of applied external forces at the hand. In the process we identified a precise role for muscles which span two or more joints in the control of overall limb stiffness. A local strategy may be used to achieve limb stability, in which the muscle stiffness increases with muscle force. Multijoint muscles are shown to provide mechanical couplings which are necessary for the maintenance of stability. By utilizing these muscles, the neuro-musculo-skeletal system can control a global property of the system (stability) with a passive local strategy.",

While the spring-mass model assumes a whole leg as a linear spring, it is still not clear how the compliant elements of muscle–tendon systems behave in a human-like segmented leg structure. This study presents a minimalistic model of compliant leg structure that exploits dynamics of biarticular tension springs. In the proposed bipedal model, each leg consists of three leg segments with passive knee and ankle joints that are constrained by four linear tension springs. We found that biarticular arrangements of the springs that correspond to rectus femoris, biceps femoris and gastrocnemius in human legs provide self-stabilizing characteristics for both walking and running gaits. Through the experiments in simulation and a real-world robotic platform, we show how behavioral characteristics of the proposed model agree with basic patterns of human locomotion including joint kinematics and ground reaction force, which could not be explained in the previous models."

	abstract = { The passive dynamics of bipedal limbs alone are sufficient to produce a walking motion, without need for control. Humans augment these dynamics with muscles, actively coordinated to produce stable and economical walking. Present robots using passive dynamics walk much slower, perhaps because they lack elastic muscles that couple the joints. Elastic properties are well known to enhance running gaits, but their effect on walking has yet to be explored. Here we use a computational model of dynamic walking to show that elastic joint coupling can help to coordinate faster walking. In walking powered by trailing leg push-off, the model's speed is normally limited by a swing leg that moves too slowly to avoid stumbling. A uni-articular spring about the knee allows faster but uneconomical walking. A combination of uni-articular hip and knee springs can speed the legs for improved speed and economy, but not without the swing foot scuffing the ground. Bi-articular springs coupling the hips and knees can yield high economy and good ground clearance similar to humans. An important parameter is the knee-to-hip moment arm that greatly affects the existence and stability of gaits, and when selected appropriately can allow for a wide range of speeds. Elastic joint coupling may contribute to the economy and stability of human gait. }

One of the most important lessons learned from nature is the significant role of compliance in simplifying control, enhancing energy efficiency and robustness against perturbations for legged locomotion. In this research, we investigate how body morphology in combination with actuator design may facilitate motor control of leg function. Inspired by the human leg muscular system, we show that biarticular muscles have a key role in balancing the upper body, joint coordination and swing leg control. Appropriate adjustment of biarticular spring rest length and stiffness can simplify the control and also reduce energy consumption. In order to test these findings, the BioBiped3 robot was developed as a new version of BioBiped series of biologically inspired, compliant musculoskeletal robots. In this robot, three-segmented legs actuated by mono- and biarticular series elastic actuators mimic the nine major human leg muscle groups. With the new biarticular actuators in BioBiped3, novel simplified control concepts for postural balance and for joint coordination in rebounding movements (drop jumps) were demonstrated and approved.}

	abstract = {When defining requirements for any wearable robot for walking assistance, it is important to maximize the user{\textquoteright}s metabolic benefit resulting from the exosuit assistance while limiting the metabolic penalty of carrying the system{\textquoteright}s mass. Thus, the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the relationship between assistance magnitude and the metabolic cost of walking while also examining changes to the wearer{\textquoteright}s underlying gait mechanics. The study was performed with a tethered multiarticular soft exosuit during normal walking, where assistance was directly applied at the ankle joint and indirectly at the hip due to a textile architecture. The exosuit controller was designed such that the delivered torque profile at the ankle joint approximated that of the biological torque during normal walking. Seven participants walked on a treadmill at 1.5 meters per second under one unpowered and four powered conditions, where the peak moment applied at the ankle joint was varied from about 10 to 38\% of biological ankle moment (equivalent to an applied force of 18.7 to 75.0\% of body weight). Results showed that, with increasing exosuit assistance, net metabolic rate continually decreased within the tested range. When maximum assistance was applied, the metabolic rate of walking was reduced by 22.83 {\textpm} 3.17\% relative to the powered-off condition (mean {\textpm} SEM).},

ABSTRACT={The bi-articular m. gastrocnemius and the mono-articular m. soleus have different and complementary functions during walking. Several groups are starting to use these biological functions as inspiration to design prostheses with bi-articular actuation components to replace the function of the m. gastrocnemius. Simulation studies indicate that a bi-articular configuration and spring that mimic the m. gastrocnemius could be beneficial for orthoses or exoskeletons. Our aim was to test the effect of a bi-articular and spring configuration that mimics the m. gastrocnemius and compare this to a no-spring and mono-articular configuration. 
We tested 9 participants during walking with knee-ankle-foot exoskeletons with dorsally mounted pneumatic muscle actuators. In the bi-articular plus spring condition the pneumatic muscles were attached to the thigh segment with an elastic cord. In the bi-articular no-spring condition the pneumatic muscles were also attached to the thigh segment but with a non-elastic cord. In the mono-articular condition the pneumatic muscles were attached to the shank segment.
We found the highest reduction in metabolic cost of 13% compared to walking with the exoskeleton powered-off in the bi-articular plus spring condition. Possible explanations for this could be that the exoskeleton delivered the highest total positive work in this condition at the ankle and the knee and provided more assistance during the isometric phase of the biological plantarflexors. As expected we found that the bi-articular conditions reduced m. gastrocnemius EMG more than the mono-articular condition. We did not find that the mono-articular condition reduces the m. soleus EMG more than the bi-articular conditions. 
Knowledge of specific effects of different exoskeleton configurations on metabolic cost and muscle activation could be useful for providing customized assistance for specific gait impairments.}

The CYBERLEGs Alpha-Prosthesis is part of the CYBERLEGs FP7-ICT project, which combines a prosthesis system to replace a lost limb in parallel with an exoskeleton to assist the sound leg, and sensory array to control both systems. The prosthesis attempts to produce a natural level ground walking gait that approximates the joint torques and kinematics of a non-amputee while maintaining compliant joints, which has the potential to decrease impulsive losses, and ultimately reduce the end user energy consumption. This first prototype consists of a passive knee and an active ankle which are energetically coupled to reduce the total power consumption of the device. Here we present simulations of the actuation system of the ankle and the passive behavior of the knee module with and without the energy transfer effects, the mechanical design of the prosthesis, and empirical results from testing of the physical device with amputee subjects."

abstract = {Movement is fundamental to human and animal life, emerging through interaction of complex neural, muscular, and skeletal systems. Study of movement draws from and contributes to diverse fields, including biology, neuroscience, mechanics, and robotics. OpenSim unites methods from these fields to create fast and accurate simulations of movement, enabling two fundamental tasks. First, the software can calculate variables that are difficult to measure experimentally, such as the forces generated by muscles and the stretch and recoil of tendons during movement. Second, OpenSim can predict novel movements from models of motor control, such as kinematic adaptations of human gait during loaded or inclined walking. Changes in musculoskeletal dynamics following surgery or due to human–device interaction can also be simulated; these simulations have played a vital role in several applications, including the design of implantable mechanical devices to improve human grasping in individuals with paralysis. OpenSim is an extensible and user-friendly software package built on decades of knowledge about computational modeling and simulation of biomechanical systems. OpenSim’s design enables computational scientists to create new state-of-the-art software tools and empowers others to use these tools in research and clinical applications. OpenSim supports a large and growing community of biomechanics and rehabilitation researchers, facilitating exchange of models and simulations for reproducing and extending discoveries.

abstract = "Summary
People prefer to move in ways that minimize their energetic cost [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. For example, people tend to walk at a speed that minimizes energy use per unit distance [5, 6, 7, 8] and, for that speed, they select a step frequency that makes walking less costly [3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12]. Although aspects of this preference appear to be established over both evolutionary [9, 13, 14, 15] and developmental [16] timescales, it remains unclear whether people can also optimize energetic cost in real time. Here we show that during walking, people readily adapt established motor programs to minimize energy use. To accomplish this, we used robotic exoskeletons to shift people’s energetically optimal step frequency to frequencies higher and lower than normally preferred. In response, we found that subjects adapted their step frequency to converge on the new energetic optima within minutes and in response to relatively small savings in cost (<5%). When transiently perturbed from their new optimal gait, subjects relied on an updated prediction to rapidly re-converge within seconds. Our collective findings indicate that energetic cost is not just an outcome of movement, but also plays a central role in continuously shaping it."

abstract = "We used a lower limb robotic exoskeleton controlled by the wearer's muscle activity to study human locomotor adaptation to disrupted muscular coordination. Ten healthy subjects walked while wearing a pneumatically powered ankle exoskeleton on one limb that effectively increased plantar flexor strength of the soleus muscle. Soleus electromyography amplitude controlled plantar flexion assistance from the exoskeleton in real time. We hypothesized that subjects’ gait kinematics would be initially distorted by the added exoskeleton power, but that subjects would reduce soleus muscle recruitment with practice to return to gait kinematics more similar to normal. We also examined the ability of subjects to recall their adapted motor pattern for exoskeleton walking by testing subjects on two separate sessions, 3 days apart. The mechanical power added by the exoskeleton greatly perturbed ankle joint movements at first, causing subjects to walk with significantly increased plantar flexion during stance. With practice, subjects reduced soleus recruitment by ∼35% and learned to use the exoskeleton to perform almost exclusively positive work about the ankle. Subjects demonstrated the ability to retain the adapted locomotor pattern between testing sessions as evidenced by similar muscle activity, kinematic and kinetic patterns between the end of the first test day and the beginning of the second. These results demonstrate that robotic exoskeletons controlled by muscle activity could be useful tools for testing neural mechanisms of human locomotor adaptation."

abstract={Computational modeling and simulation of neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) systems enables researchers and clinicians to study the complex dynamics underlying human and animal movement. NMS models use equations derived from physical laws and biology to help solve challenging real-world problems, from designing prosthetics that maximize running speed to developing exoskeletal devices that enable walking after a stroke. NMS modeling and simulation has proliferated in the biomechanics research community over the past 25 years, but the lack of verification and validation standards remains a major barrier to wider adoption and impact. The goal of this paper is to establish practical guidelines for verification and validation of NMS models and simulations that researchers, clinicians, reviewers, and others can adopt to evaluate the accuracy and credibility of modeling studies. In particular, we review a general process for verification and validation applied to NMS models and simulations, including careful formulation of a research question and methods, traditional verification and validation steps, and documentation and sharing of results for use and testing by other researchers. Modeling the NMS system and simulating its motion involves methods to represent neural control, musculoskeletal geometry, muscle-tendon dynamics, contact forces, and multibody dynamics. For each of these components, we review modeling choices and software verification guidelines; discuss variability, errors, uncertainty, and sensitivity relationships; and provide recommendations for verification and validation by comparing experimental data and testing robustness. We present a series of case studies to illustrate key principles. In closing, we discuss challenges the community must overcome to ensure that modeling and simulation are successfully used to solve the broad spectrum of problems that limit human mobility.},

abstract = {Wearable robotic devices can restore and enhance mobility. There is growing interest in designing devices that reduce the metabolic cost of walking; however, designers lack guidelines for which joints to assist and when to provide the assistance. To help address this problem, we used musculoskeletal simulation to predict how hypothetical devices affect muscle activity and metabolic cost when walking with heavy loads. We explored 7 massless devices, each providing unrestricted torque at one degree of freedom in one direction (hip abduction, hip flexion, hip extension, knee flexion, knee extension, ankle plantarflexion, or ankle dorsiflexion). We used the Computed Muscle Control algorithm in OpenSim to find device torque profiles that minimized the sum of squared muscle activations while tracking measured kinematics of loaded walking without assistance. We then examined the metabolic savings provided by each device, the corresponding device torque profiles, and the resulting changes in muscle activity. We found that the hip flexion, knee flexion, and hip abduction devices provided greater metabolic savings than the ankle plantarflexion device. The hip abduction device had the greatest ratio of metabolic savings to peak instantaneous positive device power, suggesting that frontal-plane hip assistance may be an efficient way to reduce metabolic cost. Overall, the device torque profiles generally differed from the corresponding net joint moment generated by muscles without assistance, and occasionally exceeded the net joint moment to reduce muscle activity at other degrees of freedom. Many devices affected the activity of muscles elsewhere in the limb; for example, the hip flexion device affected muscles that span the ankle joint. Our results may help experimentalists decide which joint motions to target when building devices and can provide intuition for how devices may interact with the musculoskeletal system. The simulations are freely available online, allowing others to reproduce and extend our work.},

ABSTRACT={Exoskeletons and other wearable robotic devices have a wide range of potential applications, including assisting patients with walking pathologies, acting as tools for rehabilitation, and enhancing the capabilities of healthy humans. However, applying these devices effectively in a real-world setting can be challenging, as the optimal design features and control commands for an exoskeleton are highly dependent on the current user, task and environment. Consequently, robust metrics and methods for quantifying exoskeleton performance are required.

This work presents an analysis of walking data collected for 7 healthy subjects walking with an active pelvis exoskeleton over three assistance scenarios and five walking contexts. Spatial and temporal, kinematic, kinetic and other novel dynamic metrics were compared to identify which metrics exhibit desirable invariance properties, and so are good candidates for use as a stability metric. Additionally, using a model-based approach, the average metabolic power consumption was calculated for a subset of muscles crossing the hip, knee and ankle joints, and used to analyse how energy-reducing properties of an exoskeleton are affected by changes in walking context.

The metric results demonstrated that medial-lateral centre of pressure displacement and medial-lateral margin of stability exhibit strong invariance to changes in walking conditions. This suggests these dynamic stability metrics are optimised in human gait and are potentially suitable metrics for optimising in an exoskeleton control paradigm. The effectiveness of the exoskeleton at reducing human energy expenditure was observed to increase when walking on an incline, where muscles aiding in hip flexion were assisted, but decrease when walking at a slow speed. These results underline the need for adaptive control algorithms for exoskeletons if they are to be used in varied environments.}

abstract = "Muscles actuate running by developing forces that propel the body forward while supporting the body’s weight. To understand how muscles contribute to propulsion (i.e., forward acceleration of the mass center) and support (i.e., upward acceleration of the mass center) during running we developed a three-dimensional muscle-actuated simulation of the running gait cycle. The simulation is driven by 92 musculotendon actuators of the lower extremities and torso and includes the dynamics of arm motion. We analyzed the simulation to determine how each muscle contributed to the acceleration of the body mass center. During the early part of the stance phase, the quadriceps muscle group was the largest contributor to braking (i.e., backward acceleration of the mass center) and support. During the second half of the stance phase, the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles were the greatest contributors to propulsion and support. The arms did not contribute substantially to either propulsion or support, generating less than 1% of the peak mass center acceleration. However, the arms effectively counterbalanced the vertical angular momentum of the lower extremities. Our analysis reveals that the quadriceps and plantarflexors are the major contributors to acceleration of the body mass center during running."

abstract = "Running is a bouncing gait in which the body mass center slows and lowers during the first half of the stance phase; the mass center is then accelerated forward and upward into flight during the second half of the stance phase. Muscle-driven simulations can be analyzed to determine how muscle forces accelerate the body mass center. However, muscle-driven simulations of running at different speeds have not been previously developed, and it remains unclear how muscle forces modulate mass center accelerations at different running speeds. Thus, to examine how muscles generate accelerations of the body mass center, we created three-dimensional muscle-driven simulations of ten subjects running at 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0m/s. An induced acceleration analysis determined the contribution of each muscle to mass center accelerations. Our simulations included arms, allowing us to investigate the contributions of arm motion to running dynamics. Analysis of the simulations revealed that soleus provides the greatest upward mass center acceleration at all running speeds; soleus generates a peak upward acceleration of 19.8m/s2 (i.e., the equivalent of approximately 2.0 bodyweights of ground reaction force) at 5.0m/s. Soleus also provided the greatest contribution to forward mass center acceleration, which increased from 2.5m/s2 at 2.0m/s to 4.0m/s2 at 5.0m/s. At faster running speeds, greater velocity of the legs produced larger angular momentum about the vertical axis passing through the body mass center; angular momentum about this vertical axis from arm swing simultaneously increased to counterbalance the legs. We provide open-access to data and simulations from this study for further analysis in OpenSim at simtk.org/home/nmbl_running, enabling muscle actions during running to be studied in unprecedented detail."

abstract = "Computation of muscle excitation patterns that produce coordinated movements of muscle-actuated dynamic models is an important and challenging problem. Using dynamic optimization to compute excitation patterns comes at a large computational cost, which has limited the use of muscle-actuated simulations. This paper introduces a new algorithm, which we call computed muscle control, that uses static optimization along with feedforward and feedback controls to drive the kinematic trajectory of a musculoskeletal model toward a set of desired kinematics. We illustrate the algorithm by computing a set of muscle excitations that drive a 30-muscle, 3-degree-of-freedom model of pedaling to track measured pedaling kinematics and forces. Only 10min of computer time were required to compute muscle excitations that reproduced the measured pedaling dynamics, which is over two orders of magnitude faster than conventional dynamic optimization techniques. Simulated kinematics were within 1° of experimental values, simulated pedal forces were within one standard deviation of measured pedal forces for nearly all of the crank cycle, and computed muscle excitations were similar in timing to measured electromyographic patterns. The speed and accuracy of this new algorithm improves the feasibility of using detailed musculoskeletal models to simulate and analyze movement."

abstract = {Muscles attach to bones via tendons that stretch and recoil, affecting muscle force generation and metabolic energy consumption. In this study, we investigated the effect of tendon compliance on the metabolic cost of running using a full-body musculoskeletal model with a detailed model of muscle energetics. We performed muscle-driven simulations of running at 2–5 m/s with tendon force–strain curves that produced between 1 and 10% strain when the muscles were developing maximum isometric force. We computed the average metabolic power consumed by each muscle when running at each speed and with each tendon compliance. Average whole-body metabolic power consumption increased as running speed increased, regardless of tendon compliance, and was lowest at each speed when tendon strain reached 2–3% as muscles were developing maximum isometric force. When running at 2 m/s, the soleus muscle consumed less metabolic power at high tendon compliance because the strain of the tendon allowed the muscle fibers to operate nearly isometrically during stance. In contrast, the medial and lateral gastrocnemii consumed less metabolic power at low tendon compliance because less compliant tendons allowed the muscle fibers to operate closer to their optimal lengths during stance. The software and simulations used in this study are freely available at simtk.org and enable examination of muscle energetics with unprecedented detail.},

For each user, though, a device will need to be adjusted for optimum effect, which can be time-consuming. Zhang et al. show that the human can be included in the optimization process, with real-time adaptation of an ankle exoskeleton (see the Perspective by Malcolm et al.). By using indirect calorimetry to measure metabolic rates, the authors were able to adjust the torque provided by the device while users were walking, running, and carrying a load.Science, this issue p. 1280; see also p. 1230Exoskeletons and active prostheses promise to enhance human mobility, but few have succeeded. Optimizing device characteristics on the basis of measured human performance could lead to improved designs. We have developed a method for identifying the exoskeleton assistance that minimizes human energy cost during walking. Optimized torque patterns from an exoskeleton worn on one ankle reduced metabolic energy consumption by 24.2 {\textpm} 7.4\% compared to no torque. The approach was effective with exoskeletons worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when optimizing muscle activity. Finding a good generic assistance pattern, customizing it to individual needs, and helping users learn to take advantage of the device all contributed to improved economy. Optimization methods with these features can substantially improve performance.},

Unlike techniques that track experimental data, predictive simulations synthesize gaits by minimizing a high-level objective such as metabolic energy expenditure while satisfying task requirements like achieving a target velocity. The fidelity of predictive gait simulations has only been systematically evaluated for locomotion data on flat ground. In this study, we construct a predictive simulation framework based on energy minimization and use it to generate normal walking, along with walking with a range of carried loads and up a range of inclines. The simulation is muscle-driven and includes controllers based on muscle force and stretch reflexes and contact state of the legs. We demonstrate how human-like locomotor strategies emerge from adapting the model to a range of environmental changes. Our simulation dynamics not only show good agreement with experimental data for normal walking on flat ground (92% of joint angle trajectories and 78% of joint torque trajectories lie within 1 standard deviation of experimental data), but also reproduce many of the salient changes in joint angles, joint moments, muscle coordination, and metabolic energy expenditure observed in experimental studies of loaded and inclined walking.},

abstract = { Techniques proposed for assisting locomotion with exoskeletons have often included a combination of active work input and passive torque support, but the physiological effects of different assistance techniques remain unclear. We performed an experiment to study the independent effects of net exoskeleton work and average exoskeleton torque on human locomotion. Subjects wore a unilateral ankle exoskeleton and walked on a treadmill at 1.25 m·s−1 while net exoskeleton work rate was systematically varied from −0.054 to 0.25 J·kg−1·s−1, with constant (0.12 N·m·kg−1) average exoskeleton torque, and while average exoskeleton torque was systematically varied from approximately zero to 0.18 N·m·kg−1, with approximately zero net exoskeleton work. We measured metabolic rate, center-of-mass mechanics, joint mechanics, and muscle activity. Both techniques reduced effort-related measures at the assisted ankle, but this form of work input reduced metabolic cost (−17\% with maximum net work input) while this form of torque support increased metabolic cost (+13\% with maximum average torque). Disparate effects on metabolic rate seem to be due to cascading effects on whole body coordination, particularly related to assisted ankle muscle dynamics and the effects of trailing ankle behavior on leading leg mechanics during double support. It would be difficult to predict these results using simple walking models without muscles or musculoskeletal models that assume fixed kinematics or kinetics. Data from this experiment can be used to improve predictive models of human neuromuscular adaptation and guide the design of assistive devices. }

abstract = "Robotic lower limb exoskeletons hold significant potential for gait assistance and rehabilitation; however, we have a limited understanding of how people adapt to walking with robotic devices. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that people reduce net muscle moments about their joints when robotic assistance is provided. This reduction in muscle moment results in a total joint moment (muscle plus exoskeleton) that is the same as the moment without the robotic assistance despite potential differences in joint angles. To test this hypothesis, eight healthy subjects trained with the robotic hip exoskeleton while walking on a force-measuring treadmill. The exoskeleton provided hip flexion assistance from approximately 33% to 53% of the gait cycle. We calculated the root mean squared difference (RMSD) between the average of data from the last 15min of the powered condition and the unpowered condition. After completing three 30-min training sessions, the hip exoskeleton provided 27% of the total peak hip flexion moment during gait. Despite this substantial contribution from the exoskeleton, subjects walked with a total hip moment pattern (muscle plus exoskeleton) that was almost identical and more similar to the unpowered condition than the hip angle pattern (hip moment RMSD 0.027, angle RMSD 0.134, p<0.001). The angle and moment RMSD were not different for the knee and ankle joints. These findings support the concept that people adopt walking patterns with similar joint moment patterns despite differences in hip joint angles for a given walking speed."

The purposes of this study were to quantify joint moments while healthy subjects adapted to a robotic ankle exoskeleton and to determine if the period of motor adaptation is dependent on the magnitude of robotic assistance. The pneumatically powered ankle exoskeleton provided plantar flexor torque controlled by the wearer's soleus electromyography (EMG). Eleven naïve individuals completed two 30-min sessions walking on a split-belt instrumented treadmill at 1.25m/s while wearing the ankle exoskeleton. After two sessions of practice, subjects reduced their soleus EMG activation by ∼36% and walked with total ankle moment patterns similar to their unassisted gait (r2=0.98±0.02, THSD, p>0.05). They had substantially different ankle kinematic patterns compared to their unassisted gait (r2=0.79±0.12, THSD, p<0.05). Not all of the subjects reached a steady-state gait pattern within the two sessions, in contrast to a previous study using a weaker robotic ankle exoskeleton (Gordon and Ferris, 2007). Our results strongly suggest that humans aim for similar joint moment patterns when walking with robotic assistance rather than similar kinematic patterns. In addition, greater robotic assistance provided during initial use results in a longer adaptation process than lesser robotic assistance."

We hypothesized that subjects would show a neuromotor and metabolic adaptation during a 24min walking trial with a powered exoskeleton. Nine female subjects walked on a treadmill at 1.36±0.04ms−1 during 24min with a powered exoskeleton and 4min with an unpowered exoskeleton. Subjects showed a metabolic adaptation after 18.5±5.0min, followed by an adapted period. Metabolic cost, electromyography and kinematics were compared between the unpowered condition, the beginning of the adaptation and the adapted period. In the beginning of the adaptation (4min), a reduction in metabolic cost of 9% was found compared to the unpowered condition. This reduction was accompanied by reduced muscular activity in the plantarflexor muscles, as the powered exoskeleton delivered part of the necessary ankle extension moment. During the adaptation this metabolic reduction further increased to 16%, notwithstanding a constant exoskeleton assistance. This increased reduction is the result of a neuromotor adaptation in which subjects adapt to walking with the exoskeleton, thereby reducing muscular activity in all leg muscles. Because of the fast adaptation and the significant reductions in metabolic cost we want to highlight the potential of an ankle-foot exoskeleton with kinematic control that assists ankle extension during push-off."

abstract = "We tested whether the metabolic energy cost of walking with the ankles immobilized can be comparable to normal walking. Immobilization of any lower extremity joint usually causes greater energy expenditure. Fixation of the ankle might be expected to eliminate the work it normally performs, to detrimental effect. But fixation using lightweight boots with curved rocker bottoms can also bring some benefits, so that the overall energetic effect might be quite small. We measured oxygen consumption, kinematics, and ground reaction forces in six (N=6) able-bodied human volunteers walking at 1.25m/s in three conditions: normal walking in street shoes, walking with ankles immobilized by walking boots, and normally with ankles free but also weighted to match the mass of the walking boots. We estimated metabolic energy expenditure, joint work, and overall work performed on the body center of mass as a function of ankle fixation. Ankle fixation with walking boots caused the total rate of energy expenditure for walking to increase by 4.1% compared to normal (P=0.003), but differed by an insignificant amount (0.4% less, P=0.78) compared to walking with equivalent ankle weight. Compared to normal walking, ankle fixation can reduce ankle torque and work during the stance phase, most notably during late stance. This apparently makes up for the loss of ability to push-off as normal. With a suitably lightweight apparatus and curved rocker bottom surface, loss of ankle motion need not increase energy expenditure for walking."

abstract = {1. Normal subjects performed a step test in which the quadriceps of one leg contracted concentrically while the contralateral muscle contracted eccentrically. 2. Maximal voluntary force and the force:frequency relationship were altered bilaterally as a result of the exercise, the changes being greater in the muscle which had contracted eccentrically. Recovery occurred over 24 h. 3. Electromyographic studies using three sites on each muscle showed an increase in electrical activation during the exercise only in the muscle which was contracting eccentrically. Recovery followed a time course similar to that of the contractile properties. 4. Pain and tenderness developed only in the muscle which had contracted eccentrically. Pain was first noted approximately 8 h after exercise and was maximal at approximately 48 h after exercise, at which time force generation and electrical activation had returned to pre-exercise values. 5. Eccentric contractions cause more profound changes in some aspects of muscle function than concentric contractions. These changes cannot be explained in simple metabolic terms, and it is suggested that they are the result of mechanical trauma caused by the high tension generated in relatively few active fibres during eccentric contractions.},

The respective percentages of Type I and Type II fibres were calculated and showed that there was a wide variation in fibre type proportions between the 6 samples in almost all the muscles studied. Examination of the mean fibre type proportions of each muscle revealed that predominantly tonic muscles had a high percentage of Type I fibres and predominantly phasic muscles had a high percentage of Type II fibres. Most of the muscles studied were known to fulfil both tonic and phasic functions, however, and showed no striking preponderance of either fibre type. The spatial distribution of the fibre types was examined in order to determine whether this was random or not. The number of “enclosed” fibres observed in the actual samples was compared statistically with the number expected to occur in a hexagonal lattice model, assuming a random distribution. In the great majority of muscles, the distribution of the fibre types was in fact random, though isolated instances of grouping of fibres of uniform type were noted in some distal muscles and more regularly in extensor digitorum brevis. The methods used in the quantitative assessment of the proportions and spatial distribution of the respective fibre types in normal muscle have obvious applications in the study of neuromuscular disease."

ABSTRACT={Predicting the movements, ground reaction forces and neuromuscular activity during gait can be a valuable asset to the clinical rehabilitation community, both to understand pathology, as well as to plan effective intervention. In this work we use an optimal control method to generate predictive simulations of pathological gait in the sagittal plane. We construct a patient-specific model corresponding to a 7-year old child with gait abnormalities and identify the optimal spring characteristics of an ankle-foot orthosis that minimizes muscle effort. Our simulations include the computation of foot-ground reaction forces, as well as the neuromuscular dynamics using computationally efficient muscle torque generators and excitation-activation equations. The optimal control problem (OCP) is solved with a direct multiple shooting method. The solution of this problem is physically consistent synthetic neural excitation commands, muscle activations and whole body motion. Our simulations produced similar changes to the gait characteristics as those recorded on the patient. The orthosis-equipped model was able to walk faster with more extended knees. Notably, our approach can be easily tuned to simulate weakened muscles, produces physiologically realistic ground reaction forces and smooth muscle activations and torques, and can be implemented on a standard workstation to produce results within a few hours. These results are an important contribution toward bridging the gap between research methods in computational neuromechanics and day-to-day clinical rehabilitation.}

abstract = "{Unilateral below-knee amputees develop abnormal gait characteristics that include bilateral asymmetries and an elevated metabolic cost relative to non-amputees. In addition, long-term prosthesis use has been linked to an increased prevalence of joint pain and osteoarthritis in the intact leg knee. To improve amputee mobility, prosthetic feet that utilize elastic energy storage and return (ESAR) have been designed, which perform important biomechanical functions such as providing body support and forward propulsion. However, the prescription of appropriate design characteristics (e.g., stiffness) is not well-defined since its influence on foot function and important in vivo biomechanical quantities such as metabolic cost and joint loading remain unclear. The design of feet that improve these quantities could provide considerable advancements in amputee care. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to couple design optimization with dynamic simulations of amputee walking to identify the optimal foot stiffness that minimizes metabolic cost and intact knee joint loading. A musculoskeletal model and distributed stiffness ESAR prosthetic foot model were developed to generate muscle-actuated forward dynamics simulations of amputee walking. Dynamic optimization was used to solve for the optimal muscle excitation patterns and foot stiffness profile that produced simulations that tracked experimental amputee walking data while minimizing metabolic cost and intact leg internal knee contact forces. Muscle and foot function were evaluated by calculating their contributions to the important walking subtasks of body support, forward propulsion and leg swing. The analyses showed that altering a nominal prosthetic foot stiffness distribution by stiffening the toe and mid-foot while making the ankle and heel less stiff improved ESAR foot performance by offloading the intact knee during early to mid-stance of the intact leg and reducing metabolic cost. The optimal design also provided moderate braking and body support during the first half of residual leg stance, while increasing the prosthesis contributions to forward propulsion and body support during the second half of residual leg stance. Future work will be directed at experimentally validating these results, which have important implications for future designs of prosthetic feet that could significantly improve amputee care.}",

abstract = {Although humans clearly expend more energy to walk with an extra load, it is unclear what biomechanical mechanisms contribute to that increase. One possible contribution is the mechanical work performed on the body center of mass (COM), which simple models predict should increase linearly with added mass. The work should be performed primarily by the lower extremity joints, although in unknown distribution, and cost a proportionate amount of metabolic energy. We therefore tested normal adults (N=8) walking at constant speed (1.25 m s-1) with varying backpack loads up to 40\% of body weight. We measured mechanical work (both performed on the COM and joint work from inverse dynamics), as well as metabolic energy expenditure through respirometry. Both measures of work were found to increase approximately linearly with carried load, with COM work rate increasing by approximately 1.40 W for each 1 kg of additional load. The joints all contributed work, but the greatest increase in positive work was attributable to the ankle during push-off (45{\textendash}60\% of stride time) and the knee in the rebound after collision (12{\textendash}30\% stride). The hip performed increasing amounts of negative work, near the end of stance. Rate of metabolic energy expenditure also increased approximately linearly with load, by approximately 7.6 W for each 1 kg of additional load. The ratio of the increases in work and metabolic cost yielded a relatively constant efficiency of approximately 16\%. The metabolic cost not explained by work appeared to be relatively constant with load and did not exhibit a particular trend. Most of the increasing cost for carrying a load appears to be explained by positive mechanical work, especially about the ankle and knee, with both work and metabolic cost increasing nearly linearly with added mass.},

abstract = {Although numerous studies have investigated the effects of load carriage on gait mechanics, most have been conducted on active military men. It remains unknown whether men and women adapt differently to carrying load. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of load carriage on gait mechanics, muscle activation patterns, and metabolic cost between men and women walking at their preferred, unloaded walking speed. We measured whole body motion, ground reaction forces, muscle activity, and metabolic cost from 17 men and 12 women. Subjects completed four walking trials on an instrumented treadmill, each five minutes in duration, while carrying no load or an additional 10{\%}, 20{\%}, or 30{\%} of body weight. Women were shorter (p{\textless}0.01), had lower body mass (p=0.01), and had lower fat-free mass (p=0.02) compared to men. No significant differences between men and women were observed for any measured gait parameter or muscle activation pattern. As load increased, so did net metabolic cost, the duration of stance phase, peak stance phase hip, knee, and ankle flexion angles, and all peak joint extension moments. The increase in the peak vertical ground reaction force was less than the carried load (e.g. ground force increased approximately 6{\%} with each 10{\%} increase in load). Integrated muscle activity of the soleus, medial gastrocnemius, lateral hamstrings, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and rectus femoris increased with load. We conclude that, despite differences in anthropometry, men and women adopt similar gait adaptations when carrying load, adjusted as a percentage of body weight. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Although these data are the only available and comprehensive set of inertial parameters regarding young adult Caucasians, they have been rarely utilized for biomechanical analyses of subjects belonging to the same or a similar population. The main reason is probably that Zatsiorsky et al. used bony landmarks as reference points for locating segment CMs and defining segment lengths. Some of these landmarks were markedly distant from the joint centers currently used by most researchers as reference points. The purpose of this study was to adjust the mean relative CM positions and radii of gyration reported by Zatsiorsky et al., in order to reference them to the joint centers or other commonly used landmarks, rather than the original landmarks. The adjustments were based on a number of carefully selected sources of anthropometric data."

abstract = "{Lower-limb biomechatronic devices (i.e., prostheses and exoskeletons) depend upon onboard batteries to power wearable sensors, actuators, and microprocessors, therein inherently limiting their operating durations. Regenerative braking, also termed electrical energy regeneration, represents a promising solution to the aforementioned shortcomings. Regenerative braking converts the otherwise dissipated mechanical energy during locomotion into electrical energy for recharging the onboard batteries, while simultaneously providing negative mechanical work for controlled system deceleration. This paper reviewed the electromechanical design and optimization of lower-limb biomechatronic devices with electrical energy regeneration. The technical review starts by examining human walking biomechanics (i.e., mechanical work, power, and torque about the hip, knee, and ankle joints) and proposes general design principles for regenerative braking prostheses and exoskeletons. Analogous to electric and hybrid electric vehicle powertrains, there are numerous mechatronic design components that could be optimized to maximize electrical energy regeneration, including the mechanical power transmission, electromagnetic machine, electrical drive, device mass and moment of inertia, and energy storage devices. Design optimization of these system components is individually discussed while referencing the latest advancements in robotics and automotive engineering. The technical review demonstrated that existing systems (1) are limited to level-ground walking applications and (2) have maximum energy regeneration efficiencies between 30\\% and 37\\%. Accordingly, potential future directions for research and innovation include (1) regenerative braking during dynamic movements like sitting down and slope and staircase descent and (2) utilizing high-torque-density electromagnetic machines and low-impedance mechanical power transmissions to maximize energy regeneration efficiencies.}",

abstract = {Background: Harvesting energy from human motion is an innovative alternative to using batteries as a source of electrical power for portable devices. Yet there are no guidelines as to whether energy harvesting should be preferred over batteries. This paper introduces an approach to determine which source of energy should be preferred. The proposed approach compares the metabolic power while harvesting energy and while using batteries (or any other power supply, e.g., solar panels), which provide equal amount of energy. Energy harvesting is preferred over batteries if the metabolic power required to harvest the energy is lower than that required to carry the batteries. Metabolic power can be experimentally measured. However, for design purposes, it is essential to assess differences in metabolic power as a function of the device parameters. The model: To this end, based on the proposed approach, we develop a mathematical model that considers the following parameters: the device's mass, its location on the human body, the electrical power output, cost of harvesting (COH), walking time, and the specific energy of the battery. Method: We apply the model in two ways. First, we conduct case studies to examine current ankle, knee, and back energy harvesting devices, and assess the walking times that would make these devices preferable over batteries. Second, we conduct a design scenarios analysis, which examines future device developments. Results: The case studies reveal that to be preferred over batteries, current harvesting devices located on the ankle, knee, or back would require walking for 227 hours, 98 hours, or 260 hours, respectively. This would replace batteries weighing 6.81 kg (ankle), 5.88 kg (knee), or 2.6 kg (back). The design scenarios analysis suggests that for harvesting devices to be beneficial with less than 25 walking hours, future development should focus on light harvesting devices (less than 0.2 kg) with low COH (equal or lower than 0). Finally, a comparison with portable commercial solar panels reveals that under ideal sun exposure conditions, solar panels outperform the current harvesting devices. Conclusions: Our model offers a tool for assessing the performance of energy harvesting devices.},

@article{142,
abstract = {Background: Biomechanical energy harvesting from human motion presents a promising clean alternative to electrical power supplied by batteries for portable electronic devices and for computerized and motorized prosthetics. We present the theory of energy harvesting from the human body and describe the amount of energy that can be harvested from body heat and from motions of various parts of the body during walking, such as heel strike; ankle, knee, hip, shoulder, and elbow joint motion; and center of mass vertical motion. Methods. We evaluated major motions performed during walking and identified the amount of work the body expends and the portion of recoverable energy. During walking, there are phases of the motion at the joints where muscles act as brakes and energy is lost to the surroundings. During those phases of motion, the required braking force or torque can be replaced by an electrical generator, allowing energy to be harvested at the cost of only minimal additional effort. The amount of energy that can be harvested was estimated experimentally and from literature data. Recommendations for future directions are made on the basis of our results in combination with a review of state-of-the-art biomechanical energy harvesting devices and energy conversion methods. Results: For a device that uses center of mass motion, the maximum amount of energy that can be harvested is approximately 1 W per kilogram of device weight. For a person weighing 80 kg and walking at approximately 4 km/h, the power generation from the heel strike is approximately 2 W. For a joint-mounted device based on generative braking, the joints generating the most power are the knees (34 W) and the ankles (20 W). Conclusions: Our theoretical calculations align well with current device performance data. Our results suggest that the most energy can be harvested from the lower limb joints, but to do so efficiently, an innovative and light-weight mechanical design is needed. We also compared the option of carrying batteries to the metabolic cost of harvesting the energy, and examined the advantages of methods for conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy. {\textcopyright} 2011 Riemer and Shapiro; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Test subjects walking with one device on each leg produced an average of 5 watts of electricity, which is about 10 times that of shoe-mounted devices. The cost of harvesting{\textemdash}the additional metabolic power required to produce 1 watt of electricity{\textemdash}is less than one-eighth of that for conventional human power generation. Producing substantial electricity with little extra effort makes this method well-suited for charging powered prosthetic limbs and other portable medical devices.},

abstract = {Limited research has been done on exoskeletons to enable faster movements of the lower extremities. An exoskeleton's mechanism can actually hinder agility by adding weight, inertia and friction to the legs; compensating inertia through control is particularly difficult due to instability issues. The added inertia will reduce the natural frequency of the legs, probably leading to lower step frequency during walking. We present a control method that produces an approximate compensation of an exoskeleton's inertia. The aim is making the natural frequency of the exoskeleton-assisted leg larger than that of the unaided leg. The method uses admittance control to compensate for the weight and friction of the exoskeleton. Inertia compensation is emulated by adding a feedback loop consisting of low-pass filtered acceleration multiplied by a negative gain. This gain simulates negative inertia in the low-frequency range. We tested the controller on a statically supported, single-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton that assists swing movements of the leg. Subjects performed movement sequences, first unassisted and then using the exoskeleton, in the context of a computer-based task resembling a race. With zero inertia compensation, the steady-state frequency of the leg swing was consistently reduced. Adding inertia compensation enabled subjects to recover their normal frequency of swing. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Robotic lower limb exoskeletons that can alter joint mechanical power output are novel tools for studying the relationship between the mechanics and energetics of human locomotion. We built pneumatically powered ankle exoskeletons controlled by the user{\textquoteright}s own soleus electromyography (i.e. proportional myoelectric control) to determine whether mechanical assistance at the ankle joint could reduce the metabolic cost of level, steady-speed human walking. We hypothesized that subjects would reduce their net metabolic power in proportion to the average positive mechanical power delivered by the bilateral ankle exoskeletons. Nine healthy individuals completed three 30 min sessions walking at 1.25 m s{\textendash}1 while wearing the exoskeletons. Over the three sessions, subjects{\textquoteright} net metabolic energy expenditure during powered walking progressed from +7\% to {\textendash}10\% of that during unpowered walking. With practice, subjects significantly reduced soleus muscle activity (by \~{}28\% root mean square EMG, P\&lt;0.0001) and negative exoskeleton mechanical power ({\textendash}0.09 W kg{\textendash}1 at the beginning of session 1 and {\textendash}0.03 W kg{\textendash}1 at the end of session 3; P=0.005). Ankle joint kinematics returned to similar patterns to those observed during unpowered walking. At the end of the third session, the powered exoskeletons delivered \~{}63\% of the average ankle joint positive mechanical power and \~{}22\% of the total positive mechanical power generated by all of the joints summed (ankle, knee and hip) during unpowered walking. Decreases in total joint positive mechanical power due to powered ankle assistance (\~{}22\%) were not proportional to reductions in net metabolic power (\~{}10\%). The {\textquoteleft}apparent efficiency{\textquoteright} of the ankle joint muscle{\textendash}tendon system during human walking (\~{}0.61) was much greater than reported values of the {\textquoteleft}muscular efficiency{\textquoteright} of positive mechanical work for human muscle (\~{}0.10{\textendash}0.34). High ankle joint {\textquoteleft}apparent efficiency{\textquoteright} suggests that recoiling Achilles{\textquoteright} tendon contributes a significant amount of ankle joint positive power during the push-off phase of walking in humans.},
